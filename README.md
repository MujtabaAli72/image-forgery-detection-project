🖼️ Image Forgery Detection

This project focuses on detecting copy-move image forgery using image processing and machine learning techniques. Copy-move forgery is one of the most common types of digital image manipulation, where a region of the image is copied and pasted within the same image to conceal or duplicate objects.

🚀 Features

Detects copy-move forgery in digital images.

Uses OpenCV, NumPy, and Keras/TensorFlow for image processing and model training.

Supports feature extraction techniques such as SIFT, SURF, and block-based methods.

Provides visualization of forged regions.

Easy to extend with deep learning models for enhanced accuracy.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.x

OpenCV (Image processing)

NumPy, Pandas (Data handling)

Matplotlib (Visualization)

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning models)

Keras/TensorFlow (Deep Learning integration)

📊 Results

High accuracy in detecting copy-move forgery.

Works well with common datasets such as CASIA, CoMoFoD.

📖 Future Work

Extend to splicing and retouching forgeries.

Improve detection using deep learning (CNNs, Vision Transformers).

Develop a web-based interface for real-time forgery detection.
